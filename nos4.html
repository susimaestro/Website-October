                    <p> NOS is the leading entertainment group 
                        in Portugal and NOS Play is one of their 
                        streaming services. The client wanted to 
                        create an onboarding experience for their 
                        mobile and web app in hopes to engage their 
                        customers to use the service more. After the 
                        user research it was understood a redesign 
                        was also in order to suit their needs</p>

                                   frustrations and room for improvement. Through the user and competitive
                                    research I could get a better idea of the users expectation of a

                              At this stage I wanted to know what NOS services they used, what services they
                              use to stream movies and shows and also what they like and don't like about NOS Play. 72 people
                              participated in the survey.

                                2/9 interviewees said they use NOS Play once a month, otherwise they use Netflix and HBO daily.<br> <br>I started
                                looking into their competition to find out what they did well and to see if there was something they could

                                perform on the website. I did 5 user testing with simple tasks like:
                                 "find any thriller movie" and 
                                "navigate from movies to tv shows"

                         To get into it quickly and to save myself from potentially wasting time designing I started with
                     a <b> Low-fi prototype</b> to see if the framework, my intention and navigation made sense and was intuitive. 
                     The users gave some feedback which was implemented for the <b> Mid-fi prototype </b> which was tested on <a href="http://www.useberry.com"> Useberry</a>,
                 an amazing platform where you can upload your prototype with a task for the users to complete. It records all their actions so you can see
             where they got confused. Pretty handy! From there follows more iterations and improvements untill we move on to the <b> Hi-fidelity prototype </b></p>

                    <p> When I started with this project I was very unsure on how to tackle it, which left me a bit flustered. 
                     I let the research lead the way and decide which path to take and learnt to trust
                     the process! I expected
                        to design an onboarding experience, but ended up redesigning the platform as well because of
                        what the users told me in the research phase.
                          </p>
