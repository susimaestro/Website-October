                              wouldn't be any confusion or lack of expression because of a language barrier.
                              At this stage I wanted to know what NOS services they used, what services they
                              use to stream movies and shows and also what they like and don't like about NOS Play. 72 people
                              participated in the survey.

                                stream movies and shows, and 72% use HBO. According to my survey <b> only 20% of NOS customers use NOS Play</b>.
                                2/9 interviewees said they use NOS Play once a month, otherwise they use Netflix and HBO daily.<br> <br>I started
                                looking into their competition to find out what they did well and to see if there was something they could 
                                improve on.

                                confusing to use. To dig into this deeper I thought it could be good to do a
                                UX audit in form of giving tasks to first time users and see how they
                                perform on the website. I did 5 user testing with simple tasks like:
                                 "find any thriller movie" and 
                                "navigate from movies to tv shows"
